# Badges

Other than skinning the website itself, creation of [skinned badges](skinning#badges)
is also possible. Unlike the website, if there is no skin created, no
badges can be created (it is of course still possible to download a
CSV list of all registrations and create them separately).

To create badges, use the [Attendee reports](reports#attendee) page.

It doesn't matter which fields are included, as the badge template
will always have access to all badges.
