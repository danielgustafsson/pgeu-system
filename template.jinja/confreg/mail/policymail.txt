Hello!

A registration has been made for your email address
{{reg.email}} to the conference {{conference}}.

Before we can issue your ticket and finalize the registration, we need
you to read and confirm the conference policy. It will only take
a minute, and we suggest you do this as soon as possible to make sure
your ticket is issued properly.

To view the policy and register your confirmation, please visit the
following site:

{%if not reg.attendee %}
You have also received a separate email about the option to connect
your registration to an account. Please note that that is a different
process which is optional, whereas confirming the conference policy
is mandatory.
