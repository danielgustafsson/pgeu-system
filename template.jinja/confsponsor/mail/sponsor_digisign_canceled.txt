Hello!

The digital contract sent to you for signing of a {{sponsor.level}}
sponsorship for {{conference}} has been canceled by the organisers. Due
to this, your sponsorship registration has been canceled.

If you are still interested in sponsoring {{conference}},
we ask you to restart the process and make a new registration, at
which point you will receive a new contract to sign. Please note that
the old contract being canceled means it should no longer be signed as
it is connected to the deleted registration.
