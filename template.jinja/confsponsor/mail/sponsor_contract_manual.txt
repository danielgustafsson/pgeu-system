The company details are pre-filled on the contract based on the

to match they cannot be changed -- if they are incorrect, please
let us know and we can cancel the pending sponsorship and you can sign
up again using the corrected details.

And finally, please be aware that your sponsorship is not confirmed
until the signed contract has arrived and been confirmed, so please
